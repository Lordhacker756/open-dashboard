# The Minimilistic Open Source Dashboard💜

I developed this app/chrome extension as a side project because I was fascinated with the chrome extension "Momentum" and I wanted to test out my skills to see if I would be able to make something that I can use in my daily life and Viola after a week and a lot stack overflow, here's what I came up with😄.

This current version is the basic version of the app with the basic features like to-do, greetings, weather and customizeable background images. I'll be working on making it the best free dashboard available. If you are a fellow developer, I'd love any contributions that you'd provide to this repository, for the main goal of this dashboard is promoting Open Source🥳

## Technologies Used**

* ReactJS - For frontend
* UseContextAPI - State management
* UnsplashAPI - For background images
* Free Weather API - For real time weather
* TailwindCSS - For styling the app
* Local storage - Used as a database
* A Hell Load Of Coffee☕ - What every programmer needs to stay awake😎
